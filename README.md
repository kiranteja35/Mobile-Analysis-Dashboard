# Mobile-Analysis-Dashboard
This project analyzes mobile phone data using Power BI, leveraging MySQL for data extraction and querying. The dashboard provides key insights into brand distribution, operating systems, storage capacities, battery life, 5G availability, and camera specifications. MySQL is used to filter, sort, and aggregate data before importing it into Power BI for visualization. Various SQL queries help identify high/low-priced phones, total price by brand, and 5G-enabled devices. This project is useful for market analysis, business insights, and consumer decision-making.
